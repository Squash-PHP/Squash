Localization and Internationalization: Include functions for handling localization (i.e., translating content into different languages) and internationalization (i.e., formatting dates, times, and numbers according to locale-specific conventions), making it easier to build multilingual applications.

Session Management: Provide utilities for managing user sessions (e.g., starting, destroying, and accessing session data), simplifying session handling in PHP applications.

Encryption and Hashing: Offer functions for encrypting and decrypting data, as well as generating and verifying hashes, making it easy to secure sensitive information in PHP applications.

Error Handling and Logging: Include utilities for handling errors and logging messages to various destinations (e.g., files, databases, email), helping developers debug and monitor their applications more effectively.

Caching: Implement a caching system that allows developers to easily cache data (e.g., query results, API responses) to improve application performance and reduce unnecessary database or API calls.

File System Operations: Provide functions for common file system operations (e.g., reading, writing, deleting files and directories), making it easier to work with files and directories in PHP applications.

Database Abstraction Layer: Provide a simple interface for interacting with databases, allowing developers to perform common database operations (such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records) with minimal code.

Validation Helpers: Include functions for validating common data types (e.g., email addresses, URLs, dates) and input fields (e.g., form submissions), making it easy to ensure that user input meets certain criteria.

HTTP Request and Response Handling: Offer utilities for making HTTP requests (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and parsing HTTP responses, simplifying interactions with APIs and external services.

Data Serialization and Deserialization: Provide functions for serializing and deserializing data in various formats (e.g., JSON, XML, YAML), making it easier to work with external data sources and APIs.

Regular Expression Utilities: Include utilities for working with regular expressions, such as functions for matching patterns, extracting matches, and replacing text, simplifying text processing tasks in PHP applications.

Date and Time Manipulation: Offer functions for common date and time manipulation tasks (e.g., parsing dates, formatting dates, calculating differences between dates), helping developers work with date and time data more easily.
